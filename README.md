Welcome to the repository of an AI assistant designed for camping! <br />

Inside this repository, you'll find the source code for an AI assistant that can provide domain knowledge related to camping.

The main_system folder is where the code for the AI assistant app is stored. It is built using the Django framework and includes a database to store user information. To launch the AI assistant app, you can use the command `python main_system/manage.py runserver`. <br />
